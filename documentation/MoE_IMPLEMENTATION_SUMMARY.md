# ProjectAlpha MoE System - Implementation Summary

## üéØ Mission Accomplished: Complete MoE System for ProjectAlpha

We have successfully implemented a sophisticated **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Loader** system that transforms how ProjectAlpha manages AI model resources. This system enables dynamic loading and intelligent routing of specialized SLiM experts based on query analysis and RAM constraints.
